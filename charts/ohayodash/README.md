Ohayo Dash is a Kubernetes driven start page and dashboard. All configuration is done by standard Kubernetes objects and ConfigMaps.

**This chart is not maintained by the upstream project and any issues with the chart should be raised [here](https://github.com/nikdoof/helm-charts/issues/new/choose)**

## Source Code

* <https://github.com/nikdoof/ohayodash>

## Requirements

Kubernetes: `>=1.16.0-0`

## Dependencies

| Repository | Name | Version |
|------------|------|---------|
| https://nikdoof.github.io/helm-charts/ | common | 4.5.3 |

## TL;DR

```console
helm repo add ohayodash https://nikdoof.github.io/ohayodash/
helm repo update
helm install ohayodash ohayodash/ohayodash
```

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `ohayodash`

```console
helm install ohayodash ohayodash/ohayodash
```

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall the `ohayodash` deployment

```console
helm uninstall ohayodash
```

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart **including persistent volumes** and deletes the release.

## Configuration

Read through the [values.yaml](./values.yaml) file. It has several commented out suggested values.
Other values may be used from the [values.yaml](https://github.com/k8s-at-home/library-charts/tree/main/charts/stable/common/values.yaml) from the [common library](https://github.com/k8s-at-home/library-charts/tree/main/charts/stable/common).

Specify each parameter using the `--set key=value[,key=value]` argument to `helm install`.

```console
helm install ohayodash \
  --set env.TZ="Europe/London"\
    ohayodash/ohayodash
```

Alternatively, a YAML file that specifies the values for the above parameters can be provided while installing the chart.

```console
helm install ohayodash ohayodash/ohayodash -f values.yaml
```
